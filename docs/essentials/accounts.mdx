   - **Password** - Must contain at least 8 characters including uppercase, lowercase, number, and a special character
   - **Country**
   - **First and Last Name**
3. Accept the [Terms](https://microstrate.ai/legal.html#terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://microstrate.ai/legal.html#terms)

### Email Verification

After submitting the registration form, you'll need to verify your email address. Check your inbox for an email from Microstrate titled "Confirm Your Email Address" with two verification options:

**Option 1: Login Code**
- Locate the 6-digit verification code in the email
- Enter this code on the verification screen

**Option 2: Magic Link**
- Click the "Confirm your email" link in the email
- You'll be automatically redirected to a success page where you can log into your new account

> **Important:** When logging in for the first time, we recommend setting up MFA and saving your backup codes to secure your account and enable recovery.

> **Note:** If you don't receive a verification email within 5 minutes, check your spam folder or click "Resend email" on the verification screen. Accounts not verified within 48 hours will be automatically removed and will need to be set up again.

### Best Practices for API Key Security

<Warning>
**Never share or expose your API keys.** Treat them like passwords.
</Warning>

Follow these best practices to keep your API keys secure:

1. **Store Securely**
   - Use environment variables or secure secret management systems (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
   - Never commit API keys to version control (Git, SVN, etc.)
   - Add API key patterns to your `.gitignore` file

2. **Limit Exposure**
   - Only share keys with team members who absolutely need them
   - Create separate keys for different applications or environments
   - Use descriptive names to track where each key is used

3. **Rotate Regularly**
   - Rotate keys every 3 months (before expiration)
   - Immediately rotate any key that may have been compromised
   - Maintain a key rotation schedule

4. **Monitor Usage**
   - Regularly review which API keys are active
   - Delete unused or outdated keys
   - Monitor for unusual API activity

5. **Incident Response**
   - If a key is compromised, delete it immediately
   - Generate a new key and update all applications
   - Review account activity for unauthorized access

## Security Notifications

Microstrate automatically sends email notifications for important security events to help you protect your account:

- **Email Change Requested** - When someone requests to change an account email address
- **Passkey Added** - When a new passkey is added to an account
- **Security Codes Viewed** - When recovery codes are viewed by an admin
- **Set Password** - When a password is changed
- **User Added** - When a new user is invited to your account

These notifications help you detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts. If you receive a notification for an action you didn't perform, take immediate action to secure your account.

## Completing Your Account Details

### Changing the Root Email Address

The root email address is used for the primary login and important account notifications. Only the root user can change this email address.

To change the root email:

1. Log in as the root user
2. Click your profile icon in the bottom left corner
3. Select "Settings"
4. Navigate to "Credentials"
5. Update the email address field
6. Click "Request Change"
7. Check the **old email address** for a confirmation email
8. Click the confirmation link in the email to approve the transfer
9. Once confirmed, the new email address becomes the root login

> **Important:** The old email address must approve the change before it takes effect. This security measure ensures unauthorized users cannot change your email without your knowledge. After the change is complete, the old email address can be used as the root email for a different account.

### Renaming Your Account

Your account name is used to log into your account and appears on billing statements and team invitations.

> **Important:** When updating your account name, users will no longer be able to log in using the old account name. All users in your account will receive an email notification of the change.

To update your account name:

1. Navigate to **Account Management → Account**
2. Find the "Account Name" field
3. Enter your preferred name
4. Click the "Rename Account" button

3. Click "Save"

## Managing Multiple Accounts

You can use the same email address to access multiple Microstrate accounts by using different account names for each.

### Switching Between Accounts

To switch between accounts:

1. Log out of your current account
2. On the login page, enter the **account name** for the account you want to access
3. Enter your email address and password

> **Tip:** Each account has its own unique account name. Make note of the account names you have access to for easy switching.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

3. If you're frequently timing out, try using the "Remember me" option (if available)

### I Lost My Recovery Codes

**If you're the root user:**
- Root user recovery codes cannot be recovered by anyone else
- If you've lost them and can still log in, generate new codes:
  1. Navigate to **Settings → Password and Authentication**
  2. Generate new recovery codes
  3. Store them securely in a password manager

**If you're not the root user:**
