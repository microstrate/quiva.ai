</Tip>

## Managing Users

### Updating User Roles

Only Root and Admin users can change roles.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Users">
    Go to **Account Management → Users**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select User">
    Click on the user's email address
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Change Role">
    Select the new role from the dropdown
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Click "Update Role"
  </Step>
</Steps>

Changes take effect immediately.

**Restrictions:**
- You cannot change your own role
- Admins cannot modify Root user roles
- Admins cannot assign the Root role

### Suspending Users

Temporarily restrict access without deleting the account:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find User">
    Navigate to **Account Management → Users** and click on user's email
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Suspend">
    Click the dot menu (⋮) → "Suspend"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm the suspension
  </Step>
</Steps>

**What happens:**
- User cannot log in
- All active sessions are terminated
- User resources remain in the account
- Can be reactivated by an Admin at any time

**When to use:**
- Employee on extended leave
- Temporary contractor work completed
- Investigating potential security issue
- Pending account transfer

<Note>
View suspended users by filtering for "Suspended" status in user management.
</Note>

### Terminating User Sessions

Force a user to log out from all devices:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find User">
    Navigate to **Account Management → Users** and click on user's email
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Logout">
    Click the dot menu (⋮) → "Logout"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm to terminate all sessions
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Use cases:**
- User reports device stolen
- Suspected unauthorized access
- User forgot to log out on shared computer
- Troubleshooting access issues

<Info>
Users can also manage their own sessions in their [personal settings](/essentials/security/sessions).
</Info>

### Deleting Users

Permanently remove a user from your account:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find User">
    Navigate to **Account Management → Users** and click on user's email
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delete">
    Click the dot menu (⋮) → "Delete"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm the deletion
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**This action is permanent and cannot be undone.**

What's deleted:
- User's personal settings
- User's sessions and API keys
- User's MFA settings

What's preserved:
- Resources they created (agents, flows, MCP servers)
- All data remains accessible to the team
</Warning>

## Recovery Codes

Admins can issue or view recovery codes for users who have enabled MFA.

### Issuing New Recovery Codes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find User">
    Navigate to **Account Management → Users** and click on user's email
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Issue Codes">
    Click the dot menu (⋮) → "Issue new recovery codes"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Click "I Am Sure" in the dialog
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Codes">
    Download, print, or copy the codes securely
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
When recovery codes are issued or viewed, the user receives a "Security Codes Viewed" email notification to alert them of the access.
</Info>

### Viewing Existing Codes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find User">
    Navigate to **Account Management → Users** and click on user's email
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View Codes">
    Click the dot menu (⋮) → "View recovery codes"
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Root user recovery codes** cannot be viewed by anyone else, including Admins. Root users must store their recovery codes securely as they cannot be recovered if lost.
</Warning>

## Resource Sharing

<Info>
All resources (agents, flows, MCP servers) are shared across your entire account. All team members can access resources based on their role permissions.
</Info>

**How it works:**
- Resources are organized into collections within flows
- Access is controlled by role, not by who created the resource
- When a user is deleted, their resources remain accessible to the team
- No per-user resource ownership or isolation

**Role-based access:**
- **Root/Admin:** Full access to all resources
- **Developer:** Can create, modify, and delete all resources
- **Monitor:** Can view all resources (read-only)
- **Billing:** Cannot access resources

## Best Practices

### User Lifecycle Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Onboarding New Users" icon="user-plus">
    **When adding new team members:**
    
    1. Create account with appropriate role
    2. Send invitation email
    3. Verify they receive and accept invitation
    4. Confirm they enable MFA (required for Admin/Root)
    5. Provide onboarding documentation
    6. Review access after first week
    
    Start with minimal permissions and increase as needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Regular Access Reviews" icon="calendar-check">
    **Monthly reviews:**
    - List all active users
    - Verify each user still needs access
    - Check for unused accounts (no recent activity)
    - Confirm roles are still appropriate
    
    **Quarterly reviews:**
    - Comprehensive audit of all permissions
    - Review role assignments
    - Update access based on job changes
    - Document why each elevated role is needed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Offboarding Process" icon="right-from-bracket">
    **When users leave your organization:**
    
    **Immediately:**
    1. Suspend the user account
    2. Terminate all their sessions
    
    **Within 1 hour:**
    3. Delete all their API keys
    
    **Within 24 hours:**
    4. Review their resources for any needed handoff
    5. Delete the user account
    
    **Document:**
    - Who left and when
    - What resources they managed
    - Who took over their responsibilities
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Security for Elevated Roles" icon="shield-check">
    **Mandatory for Root and Admin:**
    - Enable MFA immediately
    - Use passkeys when possible
    - Store recovery codes in password manager
    - Use strong, unique passwords
    - Review sessions monthly
    
    **Recommended for all users:**
    - Enable MFA
    - Use password manager
    - Review active sessions regularly

</AccordionGroup>

### Role Assignment Guidelines

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Small Teams (2-5)">
    **Typical structure:**
    - 1 Root (founder/owner)
    - 0-1 Admin (if needed)
    - 2-4 Developers
    
    **Why:**
    Small teams usually don't need separate Billing or Monitor roles. Developers can handle most operational tasks.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Growing Teams (6-20)">
    **Typical structure:**
    - 1 Root (owner)
    - 1-2 Admins (team leads)
    - 1 Billing (finance)
    - 3-12 Developers
    - 0-5 Monitors (stakeholders)
    
    **Why:**
    Separation of duties becomes important. Finance should handle billing independently from technical operations.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Large Orgs (20+)">
    **Typical structure:**
    - 1-2 Root (owner + backup)
    - 2-5 Admins (department leads)
    - 1-2 Billing (finance team)
    - 10+ Developers
    - 5+ Monitors
    
    **Why:**
    Clear separation of duties, compliance requirements, multiple teams and departments.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User didn't receive invitation email">
    **Solutions:**
    
    1. Check spam/junk folder
    2. Verify correct email address was entered
    3. Click "Resend Invitation" in user management
    4. Try different email address if corporate email blocks it
    5. Ask user to check email filters/rules
    
    If still not received after 10 minutes, contact support.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't change a user's role">
    **Common causes:**
    
    - You don't have Admin or Root role
    - Trying to change your own role (not allowed)
    - Admin trying to change Root user (not allowed)
    - Admin trying to assign Root role (not allowed)
    
    **Solution:**
    Ask a Root user or different Admin to make the change.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Suspended user still has access">
    **Why this happens:**
    
    Active sessions don't terminate automatically on suspension.
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Click on the user
    2. Use the "Logout" option to terminate all sessions
    3. Sessions expire after 24 hours maximum anyway
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Need to recover deleted user">
    **Unfortunately:**
    
    Deleted users cannot be recovered. You'll need to:
    1. Send a new invitation to the same email
    2. They'll need to accept and set up a new account
    3. Re-enable MFA
    4. Their old resources remain accessible to the team
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Too many Admin users">
    **Security concern:**
    
    Having too many Admins increases security risk.
    
    **Recommendation:**
    - Limit Admin to 2-5 people maximum
    - Review if all Admins still need that level of access
    - Consider downgrading some to Developer role
    - Document why each Admin role is necessary
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
