## Best Practices

### Applying Least Privilege

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Minimum Access" icon="user-lock">
    Always assign the least privileged role that allows someone to do their job:
    
    - New team member needs to view dashboards? Start with Monitor
    - Developer needs to build agents? Assign Developer (not Admin)
    - Finance needs to manage billing? Assign Billing (not Admin)
    
    You can always upgrade later if needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Limit Root and Admin Assignments" icon="crown">
    Keep these powerful roles restricted:
    
    - **Root:** 1-2 people maximum (owner + backup)
    - **Admin:** Only senior team leads and IT staff
    - **Billing:** Finance team only
    
    The more people with elevated privileges, the higher your security risk.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Regular Role Audits" icon="calendar-check">
    Review user roles quarterly:
    
    - Does each person still need their current access level?
    - Have job responsibilities changed?
    - Are there unused accounts to remove?
    - Should anyone be downgraded to a less privileged role?
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Temporary Elevated Access" icon="clock">
    Need to grant temporary elevated access?
    
    1. Upgrade the user's role
    2. Set a calendar reminder to downgrade
    3. Downgrade as soon as the task is complete
    4. Document why access was needed
    
    Don't leave elevated access in place permanently "just in case."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Role Assignment Scenarios

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Small Team (2-5 people)">
    **Recommended structure:**
    - 1 Root (founder/owner)
    - 1-2 Developers (technical team)
    - 0-1 Admin (if needed for user management)
    
    **Why:** Small teams often don't need separate Billing or Monitor roles. Developers can handle most tasks.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Growing Team (6-20 people)">
    **Recommended structure:**
    - 1 Root (owner)
    - 1-2 Admins (team leads)
    - 1 Billing (finance person)
    - 3-10 Developers (technical team)
    - 0-5 Monitors (stakeholders)
    
    **Why:** Separation of duties becomes important. Finance should handle billing separately from technical work.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Large Organization (20+ people)">
    **Recommended structure:**
    - 1-2 Root (owner + backup)
    - 2-5 Admins (department leads)
    - 1-2 Billing (finance team)
    - 10+ Developers (engineering)
    - 5+ Monitors (various stakeholders)
    
    **Why:** Clear separation of duties, multiple teams, compliance requirements.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Resource Sharing

<Info>
All resources (agents, flows, MCP servers) are shared across your entire account. Role permissions determine what users can do with these resources, not whether they can see them.
</Info>

**How roles interact with resources:**

- **Root/Admin:** Full access to all resources regardless of who created them
- **Developer:** Can create, modify, and delete resources (including those created by others)
- **Monitor:** Can view all resources but cannot modify anything
- **Billing:** Cannot access resources at all

When a user is deleted, their resources remain accessible to the team.

## Changing Roles

### How to Update a User's Role

Only Root and Admin users can change roles:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Users">
    Go to **Account Management → Users**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select User">
    Click on the user's email address
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Change Role">
    Select the new role from the dropdown
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Click "Update Role"
  </Step>
</Steps>

Changes take effect immediately.

### Restrictions

- You cannot change your own role
- Admin users cannot change Root user's role
- Admin users cannot assign the Root role to others
- Only Root users can create or modify other Root users

## Security Considerations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Require MFA for Elevated Roles" icon="shield-check">
    **Critical:** All Root and Admin users must enable MFA
    
    **Recommended:** All Developer users should enable MFA
    
    [Set up MFA →](/essentials/security/authentication)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Monitor Privileged Actions" icon="eye">
    Regularly review actions taken by Root and Admin users
    
    When available, use audit logs to track administrative changes
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Offboarding Process" icon="right-from-bracket">
    When users leave:
    1. Suspend account immediately
    2. Terminate all sessions
    3. Delete API keys
    4. Remove user within 24 hours

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I create custom roles?">
    No, QuivaWorks provides five predefined roles. These roles cover most use cases. For Enterprise customers with specific needs, contact us about custom permissions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How many Root users can I have?">
    Technically unlimited, but we strongly recommend limiting to 1-2 people (account owner and one backup). The Root role has unrestricted access including account deletion.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can Developers see billing information?">
    No, only Root, Admin, and Billing roles can access billing information. Developers focus on technical resources only.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if I'm the only Root user and lose access?">
    This is why we recommend having a backup Root user. If you're the only Root and lose access (lost MFA device, forgotten password, no recovery codes), recovery is extremely difficult. Always maintain:
    - Secure recovery codes
    - At least one backup Root user
    - Working MFA device
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can Monitor users execute flows?">
    No, Monitor role is strictly view-only. They can see flows and their configurations but cannot execute them, modify them, or trigger them.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why can't I see billing information?">
    Your role doesn't have billing access. Only Root, Admin, and Billing roles can view billing. Ask an Admin to either give you information or change your role.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
