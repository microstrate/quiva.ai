# Security Guide & Best Practices

## Introduction

Security is foundational to QuivaWorks' architecture. This guide outlines the security features available to protect your account and data, along with best practices for maintaining a strong security posture.

## Account Security Features

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

QuivaWorks provides robust MFA options to protect your account. If MFA is not active, everytime you log into your account you will be prompted to set up MFA:

#### Setting Up MFA

1. Start the process at login, or Navigate to user settings by clicking your profile icon in the bottom left and selecting "Settings"
2. Select "Password and authentication"
2. Add your preferred authentication method:
   - **Passkey**: Passwordless login. Validate your identify using touch, facial recognition, a device password, or a PIN. 
   - **Authenticator App**: Compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, and other TOTP apps
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete setup

#### Recovery Codes

When enabling MFA, you'll receive a set of recovery codes:

- Store these codes securely in a password manager or physical safe
- Each code can only be used once
- If you lose access to your MFA device, these codes provide emergency account access
- If you have used all recovery codes, you can contact an admin to issue new recovery codes for your account if needed.

### Session Management

Control how users interact with your account:

1. Navigate to **Account Settings → Security → Session Management**
2. Configure:
   - **Session Timeout**: Automatically log users out after a period of inactivity (15 minutes to 7 days)
   - **Maximum Sessions**: Limit the number of concurrent sessions per user (1-10)
   - **Session Device Tracking**: Enable to monitor which devices are accessing your account

## API Security

### API Keys

Secure your programmatic access to QuivaWorks:

1. Navigate to **Account Settings → API → Keys**
2. Keys are scoped to the user that generates them
3. Set appropriate expiration dates for all keys

### Secop Models

QuivaWorks implements Secop (Secure Operation) security models throughout the platform:

- **Resource-Based Security**: Granular permissions for every resource
- **Intent-Based Authorization**: Access based on the operation being performed
- **Least-Privilege by Default**: Services start with minimal permissions

## Security Best Practices

### Password Management

- Use unique, complex passwords (minimum 12 characters)
- Enable MFA for all user accounts, especially Admin accounts
- Never share passwords between team members
- Consider using a corporate password manager
- Implement a password rotation policy (60-90 days recommended)

### Password Recovery

If you've forgotten your password, QuivaWorks provides a secure recovery process:

1. **Initiating Password Recovery**
   - Visit the QuivaWorks login page at [https://app.quiva.ai/en/login](https://app.quiva.ai/en/login)
   - Click "Forgot password?" below the login form
   - Enter the email address associated with your account
   - Click "Send Recovery Email"

2. **Completing the Recovery Process**
   - Check your email for a message from quiva.ai (subject: "Reset Your QuivaWorks Password")
   - You'll receive either:
     - A "Reset Password" link (recommended method)
     - A temporary recovery code (alternative method)
   - If using the link, click it to open the password reset page
   - If using the code, enter it on the recovery page when prompted
   - Create a new password following the strength requirements
   - Confirm your new password
   - Click "Reset Password"

3. **Post-Recovery Security Steps**
   - After successfully resetting your password, you'll be logged in automatically
   - You'll receive an email notification confirming the password change
   - All other active sessions will be terminated
   - You may need to re-authenticate your MFA if enabled
   - Previous API keys will remain active unless manually revoked

> **Security Note:** Password reset links expire after 15 minutes. If your link has expired, you'll need to restart the recovery process.

> **Admin Recovery Options:** Account administrators can assist other users with password recovery by navigating to **Account Settings → Users**, selecting the user, and clicking "Reset Password" from the user action menu.

### Access Control

- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Regularly audit user access and permissions
- Remove unused accounts promptly
- Require MFA for all privileged accounts
- Use role-based access control consistently

### Network Security

- Access the QuivaWorks console over HTTPS only
- When possible, use a dedicated device for administrative access
- Implement corporate network controls like VPNs when accessing from untrusted networks
- Consider setting up dedicated admin workstations for highest-privilege users

### Monitoring and Auditing

QuivaWorks provides comprehensive security monitoring tools (Enterprise only):

1. Navigate to **Account Settings → Security → Audit Logs**
2. Monitor:
   - Login attempts (successful and failed)
   - Permission changes
   - Resource creation and deletion
   - Configuration modifications
   - API key usage

Set up alerts for suspicious activities:

1. Navigate to **Account Settings → Security → Alerts**
2. Configure notifications for:
   - Failed login attempts
   - New device logins
   - Administrative action alerts
   - Unusual API usage patterns
   - Account modification events

### Development Security Practices

- Keep your SDK and client libraries updated
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Never embed credentials in application code
- Use environment variables or secure secret management
- Implement proper error handling to prevent information leakage

## Incident Response

### Account Compromise Response Plan

If you believe your account has been compromised, take these immediate steps in sequence:

1. **Immediate Containment Actions**
   - Navigate to **Account Settings → Security → Emergency Actions**
   - Click "Terminate All Sessions" to force all users (including attackers) to log out
   - Click "Restrict API Access" to temporarily suspend all API keys
   - Click "Lock Account" to prevent new logins while you investigate

2. **Change Critical Credentials**
   - Immediately change your password (use a complex, unique password)
   - Reset MFA if you believe it has been compromised
   - Revoke and regenerate all API keys
   - If using SSO, alert your identity provider to reset your credentials there as well

3. **Investigate the Breach**
   - Navigate to **Account Settings → Security → Audit Logs**
   - Look for:
     - Unfamiliar IP addresses or locations
     - Unusual login times
     - Unexpected permission changes
     - Suspicious resource creation or deletion
     - API calls from unknown sources
   - Document everything for later analysis

4. **Assess and Mitigate Damage**
   - Review all account resources for unauthorized changes
   - Check **Billing → Usage** for unexpected spikes
   - Verify configuration settings haven't been altered
   - Restore from backups if necessary
   - Reset any compromised Gateway credentials

5. **Re-secure Your Account**
   - Enable MFA if it wasn't already active
   - Implement IP restrictions if possible
   - Reduce session timeout lengths
   - Review all user access and remove unnecessary permissions
   - Consider implementing SSO with stricter controls

6. **Report the Incident**
   - Contact QuivaWorks security team at [support@quiva.ai](mailto:support@quiva.ai)
   - Call the emergency response line at the number provided in your account portal

7. **Post-Incident Actions**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security policies if needed
   - Consider security training for team members
   - Implement additional security controls
   - Schedule a follow-up security review

> **Critical Note:** If you suspect the breach involves access to sensitive customer data, consult your legal team about potential notification requirements based on applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
