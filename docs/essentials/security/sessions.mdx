# Session Management

Monitor and control your active login sessions across all devices to maintain account security.

## Understanding Sessions

A session represents an active login to your QuivaWorks account. Each time you log in from a device or browser, a new session is created.

### Session Lifetimes

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Access Token" icon="clock">
    **1 Hour**
    
    Used for API requests and active browsing
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Refresh Token" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **24 Hours**
    
    Allows automatic token renewal without re-login
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
After 24 hours of inactivity, you'll need to log in again. This security measure helps protect your account from unauthorized access.
</Info>

## Viewing Active Sessions

See all devices and locations where you're currently logged in:

1. Click your profile icon in the bottom left
2. Select "Settings"
3. Navigate to "Sessions"

You'll see details for each active session:

<img 
  src="/images/essentials/user-sessions.png" 
  alt="Active Sessions List"
  style={{ maxHeight: '400px', width: 'auto' }}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

### Session Information

Each session shows:

- **Device Type** - Operating system (e.g., Macintosh, Windows, Linux)
- **Browser** - Which browser is being used (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Location** - Geographic location (when available)
- **IP Address** - The IP address accessing your account
- **Expiration** - When the session will expire (e.g., "in 14 minutes")
- **Current Session** - Marked as "Your session" with a green indicator

<Note>
Location information may show as "unknown" if geographic data isn't available for the IP address or if you're using a VPN or proxy.
</Note>

## Terminating Sessions

### Ending a Specific Session

To log out of a specific device:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Sessions**
2. Find the session you want to end
3. Click "Terminate session" for that specific session

<Tip>
Use this if you left yourself logged in on a shared computer or no longer use a particular device.
</Tip>

### Ending All Other Sessions

To log out of all devices except your current one:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Sessions**
2. Click the "Terminate sessions" button at the top
3. Confirm the action

<Warning>
This will immediately log you out of all other devices. You'll need to log in again on those devices.
</Warning>

### When to Terminate Sessions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Suspicious Activity" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Terminate immediately if you see:**
    - Unfamiliar locations or IP addresses
    - Devices you don't recognize
    - Unusual login times
    - Sessions you didn't create
    
    After terminating suspicious sessions:
    1. Change your password immediately
    2. Review recent account activity
    3. Enable MFA if not already active
    4. Consider reviewing [incident response procedures](/essentials/security/incident-response)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Forgot to Log Out" icon="door-open">
    If you left yourself logged in:
    - Public computer or shared device
    - Work computer you no longer have access to
    - Lost or stolen device
    - Device you sold or gave away
    
    Terminate those sessions immediately to protect your account.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Routine Security" icon="shield-check">
    Good security practice:
    - Review sessions monthly
    - Terminate old or unused sessions
    - Clear sessions before traveling
    - End sessions on devices you no longer use regularly
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Password Changed" icon="key">
    After changing your password, consider terminating all sessions to ensure no one with your old password can access your account.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Admin Session Management

Administrators can force users to log out from all their sessions.

### Logging Out a User (Admin Only)

1. Navigate to **Account Management → Users**
2. Click on the user's email address
3. Click the dot menu (three dots)
4. Select "Logout"

<Info>
This immediately terminates all of the user's active sessions across all devices. The user will need to log in again to access their account.
</Info>

**When to use this:**
- User reports their device was stolen
- Suspected account compromise
- Employee leaving the organization
- User forgot to log out on a shared device
- Troubleshooting access issues

## Session Security Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Review Regularly" icon="calendar-check">
    Check your active sessions at least monthly for any unfamiliar devices or locations
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use MFA" icon="shield-halved">
    Multi-factor authentication adds protection even if someone gets your session token
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Secure Devices" icon="lock">
    Use device passwords, biometrics, and encryption on devices with active sessions
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Public WiFi Caution" icon="wifi">
    Avoid logging in on untrusted networks. Use a VPN if necessary
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Additional Security Measures

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Enable MFA">
    Multi-factor authentication protects your account even if someone steals your session token. See our [Authentication Guide](/essentials/security/authentication).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Strong Passwords">
    Long, unique passwords make it harder for attackers to gain initial access. Consider using a password manager.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep Software Updated">
    Updated browsers and operating systems have the latest security patches to protect your sessions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Log Out When Done">
    Especially on shared or public computers, always log out when you're finished rather than just closing the browser.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Session expired unexpectedly">
    **Common Causes:**
    - 24 hours of inactivity passed
    - Admin terminated your sessions
    - You changed your password
    - You cleared browser cookies
    
    **Solution:**
    Simply log in again. This is normal security behavior.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't see location information">
    **Why this happens:**
    - Using VPN or proxy
    - Corporate network
    - Privacy-focused browser settings
    - Geographic data unavailable for IP
    
    **This is normal** - Location is helpful but not required. Focus on device and browser information instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Session shows wrong device">
    **Possible Reasons:**
    - Browser user agent string is generic
    - Using browser in compatibility mode
    - Remote desktop or virtualization
    - Browser extension interfering
    
    **Solution:**
    If you don't recognize the session at all, terminate it and change your password.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Too many active sessions">
    **If you see many unexpected sessions:**
    1. Click "Terminate sessions" to end all except current
    2. Change your password immediately
    3. Enable MFA if not already active
    4. Review [incident response guide](/essentials/security/incident-response)
    
    **If they're all yours:**
    - Each browser and device creates a separate session
    - Mobile apps create their own sessions
    - This is normal for users with multiple devices
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
