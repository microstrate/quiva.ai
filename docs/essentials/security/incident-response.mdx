### Data Protection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Encryption at Rest" icon="lock">
    **AES-256 Encryption**
    
    All data stored within QuivaWorks is encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption:
    - Agent configurations
    - Flow definitions
    - Conversation history
    - User data
    - API keys (hashed)
    - Backups
    
    Enterprise customers can use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for additional control.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Encryption in Transit" icon="shield-halved">
    **TLS 1.3**
    
    All data transmitted to and from QuivaWorks is protected using TLS 1.3:
    - Web console access (HTTPS)
    - API requests
    - Agent communications
    - Webhook calls
    - File uploads
    
    We do not support older, insecure protocols like SSL or TLS 1.0/1.1.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Residency" icon="globe">
    **Geographic Control**
    
    Choose where your data is processed and stored:
    - **EU** - European Union data centers (GDPR compliant)
    - **US** - United States data centers
    - **Australia** - Sydney data center
    
    Configure during account creation or modify in **Account Management → Mesh**. Your selection determines compliance with regional data protection laws.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Isolation" icon="border-all">
    **Multi-Tenant Security**
    
    Each account's data is logically isolated:
    - Separate databases per account
    - Network segmentation
    - Access controls between tenants
    - No data sharing between accounts
    
    Enterprise plans can opt for dedicated infrastructure for complete physical isolation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Infrastructure Security

## Account Security Features

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

<Warning>
MFA is strongly recommended for all users and required for Admin and Root roles.
</Warning>

QuivaWorks supports two MFA methods:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Passkeys (Recommended)">
    **Modern, phishing-resistant authentication**
    
    - Uses device biometrics (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello)
    - Based on FIDO2/WebAuthn standards
    - Cannot be phished or intercepted
    - Works across devices with synchronization
    
    [Set up passkeys →](/essentials/security/authentication#passkeys)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Authenticator Apps">
    **Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)**
    
    - Compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator
    - Works offline
    - Widely supported
    - Industry standard
    
    [Set up authenticator app →](/essentials/security/authentication#authenticator-app)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Session Management

Control and monitor access to your account:

- **Session Lifetimes**: 1-hour access tokens, 24-hour refresh tokens
- **Multi-Device Support**: Track all active sessions
- **Remote Termination**: Log out from any device remotely
- **Activity Monitoring**: See device, browser, location, and IP for each session

[Learn more about sessions →](/essentials/security/sessions)

### API Key Security

Secure programmatic access with best practices:

- **User-Scoped**: Keys inherit creator's permissions
- **3-Month Expiration**: Automatic key rotation requirement
- **Instant Revocation**: Delete compromised keys immediately
- **Environment Variables**: Never hardcode in applications

[Manage API keys →](/essentials/security/api-keys)

## Security Best Practices
