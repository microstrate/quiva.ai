    Never reuse passwords across different services. Use a password manager to track unique passwords for each account.

    Set up MFA as soon as you create your account. Don't wait until a security incident occurs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Store Recovery Codes Securely">
    Keep recovery codes in a password manager or physical safe. Never store them in email or unencrypted notes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Prefer Passkeys">
    Passkeys are more secure and convenient than authenticator apps. Use them when available.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review Sessions Regularly">
