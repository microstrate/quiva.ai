## Understanding Your Resources

### 🤖 Agents

Intelligent AI agents that connect to your data and systems to deliver consistent, validated results. Each agent includes:
- Output schema validation with automatic correction loops
- Auto-improving prompts based on agent settings and usage
- Smart context management across conversations
- Custom business logic and instructions

### ⚡ Flow Runs

A flow run represents one complete execution of an automated workflow from start to finish. This includes all agent interactions, API calls, validation loops, data transformations, and business logic processing within that workflow. You're only charged for actual workflow executions, not idle time.

### 💾 Storage

Unified storage for all your agent data including:
- Conversation history and agent memory
- Workflow outputs and execution logs
- Document processing and file uploads
- System logs and monitoring data

This integrated approach eliminates the need to manage separate storage services.

### 🌍 Edge Locations

Deploy your agents closer to your users and data sources for optimal performance. Multiple edge locations provide:
- Reduced latency for global operations
- Redundancy and high availability
- Regional compliance options (GDPR, etc.)

Available regions: EU, US, Australia (Sydney). Additional regions on Enterprise plans.

[Configure regions →](/essentials/account/account-settings#managing-account-regions)

### 🔄 Concurrent Executions

The number of flows that can run simultaneously in your account. This ensures your workflows execute promptly without queueing delays during peak usage periods. Higher concurrency means better responsiveness for time-sensitive automations.

## What Happens at Plan Limits

### Flow Runs Exceeded

If you exceed your monthly flow run limit:

**On Free Plan:**
- You must upgrade to continue running flows
- Flows are not queued or saved

**On Paid Plans:**
- Additional flow runs are added to an error queue
- Queue flows can be replayed next month when limits reset
- Or upgrade immediately to process queued flows

[Manage billing →](/essentials/account/billing-subscriptions)

### Concurrent Executions Exceeded

If you exceed your concurrency limit:

**Request/Response Flows:**
- Return a 429 rate limit error
- Retry after a brief delay

**Async Flows:**
- Automatically queued
- Processed when capacity becomes available

**Solution:**
Upgrade to a plan with higher concurrency for peak workloads.
