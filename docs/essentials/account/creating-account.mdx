## Step 5: Secure Your Account

<Warning>
**Critical Security Step:** Enable multi-factor authentication immediately after account creation.
</Warning>

You'll be prompted to set up MFA on your first login:

1. Choose your authentication method:
   - **Passkey** (Recommended) - Use biometrics or device PIN
   - **Authenticator App** - Use Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.

2. Follow the setup instructions

3. **Save your recovery codes** in a secure location:
   - Password manager (recommended)
   - Encrypted file
   - Physical safe

<Note>
Recovery codes are your backup access method if you lose your MFA device. Store them securely as they can't be recovered if lost.
</Note>
