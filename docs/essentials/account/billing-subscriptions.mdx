## Understanding Your Bill

### Billing Cycles

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Monthly Billing">
    - Charged on the same day each month
    - Based on your signup or upgrade date
    - Usage resets on billing date
    - Example: Signed up Jan 15 → billed on 15th of each month
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Annual Billing">
    - Charged once per year
    - Save 20% compared to monthly
    - Usage limits are monthly (still reset monthly)
    - Example: Signed up Jan 15 → next charge Jan 15 next year
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Prorated Charges

When you upgrade mid-cycle, you're charged a prorated amount:

**How it works:**
1. Credit for unused time on old plan
2. Charge for remaining time on new plan
3. Net difference is charged immediately

**Example:**
- Current plan: Starter ($20/month)
- Upgrade on day 15 of 30-day cycle
- New plan: Pro ($100/month)
- Prorated charge ≈ $40 (half the difference for remaining days)
