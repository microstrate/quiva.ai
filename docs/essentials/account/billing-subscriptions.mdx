    - Pro: \$125/month
    - Team: \$625/month
    
    **Details:**
    - Charged on the same day each month
    - Based on your signup or upgrade date
    - Usage resets on billing date
    - Example: Signed up Jan 15 → billed on 15th of each month
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Annual Billing (Save 20%)">
    **Pricing:**
    - Starter: \$20/month (\$240/year)
    - Pro: \$100/month (\$1,200/year)
    - Team: \$500/month (\$6,000/year)
    
    **Details:**

    - Example: Signed up Jan 15 → next charge Jan 15 next year

### Prorated Charges

When you upgrade mid-cycle, you're charged a prorated amount:

**How it works:**
1. Credit for unused time on old plan
2. Charge for remaining time on new plan
3. Net difference is charged immediately

**Example:**
- Current plan: Starter (\$20/month annual billing)
- Upgrade on day 15 of 30-day cycle
- New plan: Pro (\$100/month annual billing)
- Prorated charge ≈ \$40 (half the difference for remaining days)

### What You're Charged For
