The Email trigger allows you to trigger flows when emails are received at a specific email address. Perfect for automating customer support, processing lead inquiries, handling support tickets, and any workflow that starts with an email.

When you add an Email trigger, you can generate unique email addresses for both draft and published versions of your flow. Any email sent to these addresses will trigger the corresponding version of your flow with the full email content and attachments.

---

## How It Works

1. Add an Email trigger to your flow
2. Click on "Trigger" in the left sidebar, then click "Get New" to generate unique email addresses
3. quiva.ai generates two unique email addresses:
   - One for triggering the **draft** version of your flow
   - One for triggering the **published** version of your flow
4. Save the trigger configuration
5. Configure email forwarding or share the addresses with users
6. When emails arrive at these addresses, your flow triggers automatically with the full email content, attachments, and metadata

---

## Configuration

### Generating Email Addresses

When you add an Email trigger to your flow:

1. Click on **"Trigger"** in the left sidebar
2. Click the **"Get New"** button
3. quiva.ai automatically generates two unique email addresses:

**Draft Flow Address:**
```
trigger+draftsparklyjollybubble650@quiva.ai
```

**Published Flow Address:**
```
trigger+sparklyjollybubble650@quiva.ai
```

**Important Notes:**
- The draft address triggers your draft flow (for testing before publishing)
- The published address triggers your live published flow
- Each flow gets unique addresses that are permanent and don't change
- Click "Copy" next to each address to easily copy them to your clipboard

### Email Forwarding

You can forward emails from your existing email address to the quiva.ai email addresses. This allows you to use your branded email address (like support@yourcompany.com) while triggering quiva.ai flows.

#### Gmail

1. Open Gmail Settings (click the gear icon, then "See all settings")
2. Go to the **"Forwarding and POP/IMAP"** tab
3. Click **"Add a forwarding address"**

### Gmail Filters (Advanced)

For more control, you can create Gmail filters to forward only specific emails:

1. In Gmail, search for emails using the criteria you want (e.g., `subject:support`)
2. Click the search options dropdown and refine your criteria
3. Click **"Create filter"**
4. Check **"Forward it to"** and select your quiva.ai address
5. Optionally, choose other actions (like skip inbox, apply label, mark as read)
6. Click **"Create filter"**

**Examples:**
- Forward only emails with "support" in subject
- Forward only emails from specific domains
- Forward only emails with attachments
- Forward only unread emails

### Response Mode

**Run in Background (Default):**

Email triggers flow immediately, sender receives no automatic response. Flow processes email asynchronously. Best for most email automation scenarios.

**Send Auto-Reply:**

Configure automatic reply sent to sender. Useful for acknowledgment messages. Reply text can include dynamic content from flow.

Example auto-reply:
```
Thank you for contacting us! We've received your message and will respond within 24 hours.

Reference ID: {{executionId}}
```

### Spam Filtering

Built-in spam filtering protects your flows. Common spam patterns blocked automatically. Known spam sources rejected. You can configure additional filters.

**Custom filters:**
- Block specific sender domains
- Require specific subject keywords
- Minimum/maximum email length
- Block emails with no body text

## Best Practices

### Testing with Draft Address

**Always test your flow using the draft address first:**

1. Send test emails to your draft address (`trigger+draft...@quiva.ai`)
2. Monitor the execution in your flow's draft environment
3. Verify all steps work correctly with real email data
4. Check that integrations and API calls function as expected
5. Only use the published address once testing is complete

**Benefits:**
- Test with real emails without affecting production
- Iterate quickly on your flow design
- Avoid errors in your live workflow
- Safely test with sensitive data

### Email Validation

**Always validate email content:**

Check sender is legitimate. Verify email has required content. Validate attachments if expected. Check for spam indicators.
```javascript
// Validate sender domain
const senderEmail = $.trigger.email.from_email;
const allowedDomains = ['company.com', 'partner.com'];
const senderDomain = senderEmail.split('@')[1];

if (!allowedDomains.includes(senderDomain)) {
  return 'unauthorized_sender';
}

// Check subject has content
if (!$.trigger.email.subject || $.trigger.email.subject.trim() === '') {
  return 'missing_subject';
}

// Verify body has content
if (!$.trigger.email.text || $.trigger.email.text.length < 10) {
  return 'insufficient_content';
}
```

### Error Handling

**Handle email processing errors gracefully:**

Catch parsing errors. Handle missing attachments. Manage invalid email formats. Provide fallback processing.
```javascript
try {
  // Process email
  const data = await processEmail($.trigger.email);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Email processing failed:', error);
  
  // Send error notification
  await sendErrorNotification({
    emailId: $.trigger.email.message_id,
    error: error.message,
    sender: $.trigger.email.from
  });
  
  return 'processing_error';
}
```

### Attachment Handling

**Process attachments carefully:**

Check attachment count. Validate file types. Scan for malware. Handle large attachments.
```javascript
const attachments = $.trigger.email.attachments;

// Check attachment limit
if (attachments.length > 5) {
  return 'too_many_attachments';
}

// Validate each attachment
for (const attachment of attachments) {
  // Check file type
  const allowedTypes = ['application/pdf', 'image/jpeg', 'image/png'];
  if (!allowedTypes.includes(attachment.contentType)) {
    return 'invalid_attachment_type';
  }
  
  // Check file size (max 10 MB)
  if (attachment.size > 10485760) {
    return 'attachment_too_large';
  }
}
```

### Response Management

**Send appropriate responses:**

Acknowledge receipt quickly. Provide reference numbers. Set expectations. Include helpful information.

**Good auto-reply:**
```
Thank you for contacting us!

We've received your email and will respond within 24 hours.

Reference Number: REF-{{executionId}}
Subject: {{email.subject}}

For urgent matters, please call: 1-800-SUPPORT

Best regards,
Support Team
```

**Avoid:**
- Generic "email received" without details
- No reference number
- No timeline expectations
- No alternative contact methods

### Security Considerations

**Protect against malicious emails:**

Validate sender domains. Check for phishing indicators. Scan attachments for malware. Rate limit email processing. Monitor for suspicious patterns.

**Red flags:**
- Sender domain doesn't match claimed organization
- Suspicious links in email body
- Executable attachments
- Requests for sensitive information
- Urgency or threat language

### Email Forwarding Tips

**Best practices for email forwarding:**

- **Always verify the forwarding address** before it becomes active
- **Check if your email service allows filters** to forward only specific emails (recommended for high-volume inboxes)
- **Be aware that some email services may disable forwarding** if you receive too many spam messages
- **Keep your original inbox as a backup** in case forwarding fails
- **Test with the draft address first** before using the published address
- **Use Gmail filters** to forward only relevant emails and reduce noise
- **Monitor your flow execution logs** to ensure emails are being received

### Performance Optimization

**For high-volume email:**

Use background processing. Implement queue management. Set priority levels. Monitor processing times.

**For large attachments:**

Process asynchronously. Store attachments externally. Clean up after processing. Implement size limits.

## Email Parsing

### Extract Information

Use agents to extract structured data from emails:
```javascript
// Agent prompt
const agentPrompt = `
Extract the following information from this email:
- Customer name
- Order number
- Issue description
- Urgency level (low/medium/high)

Email content:
${$.trigger.email.text}
`;

// Agent will return structured data
```

### Parse Common Formats

**Order confirmations:**
- Order number patterns
- Tracking numbers
- Product details
- Delivery dates

**Support requests:**
- Issue descriptions
- Product/service mentioned
- Account identifiers
- Contact preferences

**Lead inquiries:**
- Company name
- Contact person
- Requirements
- Budget/timeline

### Handle Email Threads

Detect if email is part of thread:
```javascript
// Check for reply
const isReply = $.trigger.email.headers['in-reply-to'] !== undefined;

// Get thread ID
const threadId = $.trigger.email.headers['references'] || 
                 $.trigger.email.headers['in-reply-to'];

// Extract only new content (not quoted text)
const emailBody = $.trigger.email.text;
const newContent = emailBody.split('On ')[0]; // Simple approach
```

---

## Email Response

### Send Reply Email

Use HTTP Request step to send email response:
```javascript
// Send via your email service
await axios.post('https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send', {
  personalizations: [{
    to: [{ email: $.trigger.email.from_email }],
    subject: `RE: ${$.trigger.email.subject}`
  }],
  from: { email: 'support@company.com' },
  content: [{
    type: 'text/plain',
    value: 'Your response here...'
  }],
  reply_to: {
    email: 'support@company.com'
  },
  headers: {
    'In-Reply-To': $.trigger.email.headers['message-id'],
    'References': $.trigger.email.headers['message-id']
  }
});
```

### Auto-Reply Configuration

Set up auto-reply in trigger settings:

**Enable Auto-Reply:** Toggle on in trigger configuration.

**Reply Template:** Use dynamic variables.

**Available variables:**
- `{{email.subject}}` - Original subject
- `{{email.from}}` - Sender address
- `{{executionId}}` - Execution ID for reference
- `{{timestamp}}` - Current timestamp

**Example template:**
```
Hi {{email.from_name}},

Thank you for your email regarding "{{email.subject}}".

We've received your message and are processing it now.

Reference: {{executionId}}
Received: {{timestamp}}

We'll get back to you shortly!

Best regards,
Support Team
```

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Triggering Flow

**Check email forwarding:** Verify forwarding is set up correctly in your email provider.

**Verify trigger addresses:** Ensure you're sending to the correct quiva.ai address (draft or published).

**Check flow is active:** Ensure flow is saved and trigger configuration is complete.

**Review email forwarding confirmation:** Some providers require confirmation before forwarding becomes active.

**Check spam/junk folder:** Your email service might be filtering forwarded emails.

**Review execution logs:** Check your flow's execution logs to see if emails are being received.

### Email Forwarding Not Working

**Gmail:**
- Ensure you completed the verification step
- Check that forwarding is enabled in settings
- Verify the forwarding address is correct
- Check for filters that might be blocking forwarding

**Outlook:**
- Confirm forwarding is enabled
- Check if "keep a copy" is affecting delivery
- Verify email isn't being moved to folders before forwarding

**Yahoo Mail:**
- Ensure verification was completed
- Check that forwarding is enabled
- Verify no filters are blocking forwarding

**General tips:**
- Wait a few minutes after setting up forwarding (propagation time)
- Send a test email to verify forwarding works
- Check your original inbox to see if email arrived before forwarding

### Missing Email Content

**Check email format:** Some emails might be malformed.

**Verify encoding:** Check character encoding is supported.

**Check for attachments:** Content might be in attachments instead of body.

**Review headers:** Check if content-type is supported.

### Attachment Issues

**File not accessible:** Verify attachment path is correct.

**Corrupted attachment:** Request sender to resend.

**Unsupported format:** Check file type is supported.

**Size limit exceeded:** Attachment too large for processing.

### Processing Delays

**High volume:** Many emails arriving simultaneously.

**Large attachments:** Processing time increases with size.

**Complex flows:** Flow has many steps or external API calls.

**External service delays:** Third-party APIs responding slowly.
