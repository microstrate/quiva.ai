# Triggers Overview

Triggers are the starting point for every flow. They define how and when your flow executes, what data it receives, and how it responds. Think of triggers as the "on switch" that activates your intelligent agents and automation.

## What is a Trigger?

A trigger is an event that starts your flow execution. When the trigger fires, it:

1. **Starts the flow** - Initiates the execution
2. **Provides data** - Passes information to the first step
3. **Determines response mode** - Synchronous or asynchronous
4. **Handles the response** - Returns results to the caller (if applicable)

## Choosing the Right Trigger

### Decision Framework

<Card title="How to Choose a Trigger Type" icon="question-circle">
**Ask yourself:**

1. **Who/what starts the flow?**
   - User on website → Embed (Button/Form/Chat)
   - External service → Webhook
   - Your application → HTTP Request
   - Time-based → Schedule
   - User uploads file → Upload
   - User sends email → Email
   - Internal system event → Stream Triggers

2. **Is it user-facing?**
   - Yes, users interact directly → Embed Triggers
   - No, system-to-system → HTTP Request, Webhook, Stream

3. **Does it need immediate response?**
   - Yes → Embed, HTTP Request, Webhook
   - No → Schedule, Upload, Email (can be async)

4. **How often does it run?**
   - Continuously (on-demand) → Embed, HTTP, Webhook, Upload, Email
   - Scheduled → Schedule trigger
   - Event-driven → Webhook, Stream

5. **What data format?**
   - Form fields → Form Embed
   - JSON → HTTP Request, Webhook
   - File → Upload
   - Email → Email trigger
   - Stream message → Stream triggers
</Card>

## Trigger Configuration Basics

### Common Settings

While each trigger type has specific settings, most triggers share these common configurations:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trigger Name" icon="tag">
    Give your trigger a descriptive name.
    
    **Good names:**
    - "Contact Form - Homepage"
    - "Stripe Payment Webhook"
    - "Daily Sales Report Schedule"
    - "Invoice Upload Processor"
    
    **Bad names:**

    Clear names help you identify triggers in flows with multiple triggers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Response Mode" icon="bolt">
    How should the flow execute?
    
    **Wait for Completion:**
    - Flow completes before responding
    - User/caller waits for result
    - Best for: User-facing interactions, APIs returning data
    
    **Run in Background:**
    - Responds immediately
    - Flow runs asynchronously
    - Best for: Long-running tasks, scheduled jobs, email processing
    
    *See individual trigger pages for specific recommendations.*
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Security" icon="lock">
    How to secure your trigger?
    
    **Public (No Security):**
    - Anyone with URL can trigger
    - Best for: Public forms, general website interactions
    
    **API Key:**
    - Requires API key in request
    - Best for: Server-to-server, internal APIs
    - Generate key in trigger configuration
    
    **OAuth (Future):**
    - User authentication required
    - Best for: User-specific actions
    
    *Availability varies by trigger type.*
  </Accordion>

## Trigger Data Flow

### How Data Flows from Trigger to Steps

When a trigger fires, it passes data to the flow. This data is accessible in all subsequent steps using variable mapping.

**Example: Form Embed Trigger**

```json
// Data from form submission
{
  "trigger": {
    "type": "embed_form",
    "form": {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "company": "Acme Corp",
      "message": "Interested in Enterprise plan"
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-10-14T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Accessing in Agent Step:**

```
Prompt: ${trigger.form.message}

Agent receives: "Interested in Enterprise plan"
```

**Accessing in HTTP Request Step:**

```json
Request Body:
{
  "name": "${trigger.form.name}",
  "email": "${trigger.form.email}",
  "source": "website_form"
}
```

### Multiple Triggers in One Flow

Flows can have multiple triggers:

```
Flow: Lead Processing
├─ Trigger 1: Form Embed (Website contact form)
├─ Trigger 2: HTTP Request (Landing page API)
└─ Trigger 3: Webhook (CRM integration)

All three trigger the same flow, but with different data sources.
```

**Use cases:**
- Accept leads from multiple sources
- Process payments from different channels
- Unified handling with varied inputs

## Testing Triggers

### Test Before Deploying

Always test triggers before going live:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Trigger">
    Set up your trigger with all required settings
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Flow">
    Save your flow (no need to deploy yet)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Test Panel">
    Click **Test** in flow builder
    - Simulates trigger with test data
    - Shows complete flow execution
    - Validates configuration
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Real Trigger">
    For certain triggers, test the real endpoint:
    - **Embed**: Use preview URL
    - **HTTP**: Call endpoint with curl/Postman
    - **Webhook**: Use webhook testing tools
    - **Schedule**: Set near-term test time
    - **Upload**: Upload test file
    - **Email**: Send test email
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Results">
    Check that:
    - Flow triggered correctly
    - Data passed as expected
    - Agent processed correctly
    - Response returned (if applicable)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Once testing succeeds, deploy your flow
  </Step>
</Steps>

    **Solutions:**
    - Review trigger output in logs
    - Test variable mappings in test panel
    - Check for typos in field names
    - Use JSONPath correctly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Trigger timing out" icon="clock">
    **Causes:**
    - Flow takes too long (> 30 seconds)

    - Implement request queuing
    - Increase limits if legitimate
    - Add CAPTCHA if spam
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Security issues" icon="shield-exclamation">
    **If trigger is being abused:**
    - Add/tighten rate limits immediately
    - Require API key authentication
    - Review and block malicious IPs
    - Add input validation
    - Monitor logs for patterns
    - Consider moving to private endpoint
