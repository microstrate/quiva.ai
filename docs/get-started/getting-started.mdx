During setup, select your preferred regions. You can modify these later in **Account Management → Mesh**.

<Tip>
Choose regions close to your users for lower latency. For compliance needs (GDPR, etc.), select regions that meet your data residency requirements.
</Tip>

## Secure Your Account

<Warning>
Before building agents, secure your account with multi-factor authentication.
</Warning>

We strongly recommend setting up MFA on your first login:

1. You'll be prompted to enable MFA after verifying your email
2. Choose your authentication method:
   - **Passkey** (Recommended) - Use biometrics or device PIN
   - **Authenticator App** - Use Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.
3. Save your recovery codes in a secure location
