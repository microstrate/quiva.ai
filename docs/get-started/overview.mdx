## Core Capabilities

### 🤖 Intelligent Agents

Build agents that don't just follow scripts—they think, adapt, and make decisions:

- **Delegated Intelligence**: Agents follow instructions, use your tools, and make judgements within boundaries you control
- **Production-Ready Guardrails**: Output validation with auto-correction, human-in-the-loop approvals, and configurable rules
- **Self-Optimizing**: AI prompting that automatically improves based on usage patterns
- **Smart Context**: Intelligent memory management across conversations

<Tip>
**What makes QuivaWorks agents different?** Unlike simple chatbots or rigid automation, our agents handle real-world complexity—making contextual decisions, handling exceptions, and working across your entire business.
