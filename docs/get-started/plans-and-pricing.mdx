## Understanding Your Resources

### 🤖 Agents

Intelligent AI agents that connect to your data and systems to deliver consistent, validated results. Each agent includes:
- Output schema validation with automatic correction loops
- Auto-improving prompts based on agent settings and usage
- Smart context management across conversations
- Custom business logic and instructions

### ⚡ Flows

A flow represents one complete execution of an automated workflow from start to finish. This includes all agent interactions, API calls, validation loops, data transformations, and business logic processing within that workflow. You're only charged for actual workflow executions, not idle time.

### 💾 Storage

Unified storage for all your agent data including:
- Conversation history and agent memory
- Workflow outputs and execution logs
- Document processing and file uploads
- Custom functions and code
- Stream, key-value, and object storage
- System logs and monitoring data

This integrated approach eliminates the need to manage separate storage services.

### ⚙️ Compute Hours

Compute hours measure the processing power used by your workflows. One compute hour equals a 2GB function running for one hour. Most workflow executions are very efficient, completing in approximately 200ms or less, so your monthly allocation provides thousands of executions.

**Example usage:**
- Simple automation: ~50-100ms per execution
- Agent interactions: ~100-300ms per execution  
- Complex multi-agent workflows: ~500ms-2s per execution
- Data processing tasks: Variable based on data volume

### 🌍 Data Processing Regions

**Available on Enterprise plans only**

Choose where your data is processed to optimize performance and meet compliance requirements:
- Reduced latency for regional operations
- Compliance with data residency requirements (GDPR, etc.)
- Available regions: EU (UK), US, Australia (Sydney)

Enterprise customers can select their preferred data processing region during setup.

### 🔄 Concurrent Executions

The number of flows that can run simultaneously in your account. This ensures your workflows execute promptly without queueing delays during peak usage periods. Higher concurrency means better responsiveness for time-sensitive automations.

## What Happens at Plan Limits

### Flows Exceeded

If you exceed your monthly flow limit:

**On Free Plan:**
- You must upgrade to continue running flows
- Flows are not queued or saved

**On Paid Plans:**
- Additional flows are added to an error queue
- Queue flows can be replayed next month when limits reset
- Or upgrade immediately to process queued flows

### Compute Hours Exceeded

If you exceed your monthly compute allocation:

**On Free Plan:**
- You must upgrade to continue running compute-intensive workflows

**On Paid Plans:**
- Overage charges apply: **$3 per compute hour**
- Upgrade to a higher plan for better value at scale

### Storage Exceeded

If you exceed your storage allocation:

**On Free Plan:**
- You must upgrade to continue adding data

**On Paid Plans:**
- Overage charges apply: **$1 per GB per month**
- Upgrade to a higher plan for better value at scale

### Concurrent Executions Exceeded

**Request/Response Flows:**
- Return a 429 rate limit error
- Retry after a brief delay

**Async Flows:**
- Automatically queued
- Processed when capacity becomes available

**Solution:**
Upgrade to a plan with higher concurrency for peak workloads.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do flows work?">
    Each time a workflow executes from start to finish, it counts as one flow. This includes all agent processing, API calls, validation loops, and business logic within that execution. You only pay for actual workflow runs, not idle time.

  <Accordion title="What are compute hours?">
    Compute hours measure the processing power used by the steps in your workflows. One compute hour equals a 2GB function running for one hour. Most workflow step executions are very efficient, completing in approximately 200ms or less, so your monthly allocation provides thousands of executions. Complex multi-agent workflows may use more compute, but you'll typically get thousands of executions from your monthly allocation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's included in storage?">
    Storage includes everything your agents need: conversation history, workflow logs, uploaded documents, custom functions, stream/key-value/object storage, and system monitoring data. This unified storage eliminates the need for separate storage services.
