## Overview

Microstrate is built around several core concepts that work together to create intelligent, reliable AI agent systems. Understanding these concepts will help you design and implement effective solutions for your business needs.

## Smart Agents

At the heart of Microstrate are **Smart Agents** - AI-powered entities that can understand context, make decisions, and interact with your systems and data.

<Card title="What makes an agent 'smart'?" icon="brain">
  Unlike simple chatbots, Microstrate agents have built-in intelligence features that make them reliable for production use
</Card>

### Key Agent Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Output Schema Validation">
    Agents automatically validate their responses against defined schemas. If output doesn't match requirements, the agent enters a correction loop to fix issues before proceeding.
    
    **Example**: An agent generating customer reports will automatically verify all required fields are present and correctly formatted before sending.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Self-Improving Prompts">
    AI prompting that automatically optimizes based on agent settings, usage patterns, and success rates. Your agents get better over time without manual intervention.
    
    **Example**: An agent handling support tickets learns to provide more relevant responses based on resolution success rates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Smart Context Management">
    Intelligent memory system that includes relevant conversation history and context while filtering out unnecessary information to maintain performance.
    
    **Example**: A sales agent remembers previous customer interactions but doesn't get overwhelmed by irrelevant historical data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Custom Instructions">
    Define business-specific behavior, tone, and response patterns that align with your company's standards and requirements.
    
    **Example**: Configure agents to follow your brand voice, compliance requirements, and escalation procedures.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Flows and Workflows

**Flows** are visual representations of business processes that connect agents, systems, and human decision points into coherent workflows.

## MCP Servers

**Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers** provide standardized interfaces between agents and external systems, tools, and data sources.

<Info>
  MCP is an open standard that enables AI agents to securely connect to various tools and data sources in a consistent way.
