# Understanding Agents

Agents are the intelligence layer of QuivaWorks. They're AI-powered workers that can understand context, reason through problems, use tools, and make decisions—all within boundaries you define.

## What is an Agent?

An agent is an AI that can:

- **Understand** - Parse natural language and complex data
- **Reason** - Think through problems step-by-step
- **Act** - Use tools and APIs to accomplish tasks
- **Decide** - Make judgements based on policies and context
- **Adapt** - Handle exceptions and edge cases

Unlike rigid automation or simple chatbots, agents work more like human employees: you give them a goal, the tools they need, and boundaries to operate within—then they figure out how to accomplish the task.

## Agents vs. Automation vs. Chatbots

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Traditional Automation" icon="gears">
    **"If this, then that"**
    
    Follows exact rules. Breaks on exceptions. Requires programming every scenario.
    
    ❌ Can't handle variability  
    ❌ Needs explicit programming  
    ❌ Brittle with edge cases

## Core Agent Capabilities

### 1. Intelligence & Reasoning

Agents can:
- Understand natural language and intent
- Reason through multi-step problems
- Handle ambiguity and edge cases
- Learn from context and conversation history
- Apply business logic flexibly

<Card title="Example: Customer Service" icon="headset">
**Customer**: "I want to return this shirt but I lost the receipt. It's been 35 days."

**Traditional Automation**: Breaks (doesn't match exact return scenario)

**Agent**: 
1. Understands customer wants to return an item
2. Checks order history (using tool)
3. Sees purchase was 35 days ago (5 days past standard policy)
4. Reviews return policy (using tool)
5. Notes customer has good history and high lifetime value
6. **Decides** to approve as one-time exception
7. Processes return and explains decision to customer
</Card>

### 2. Tool Usage

Agents can use tools (connectors) to:
- Search knowledge bases
- Query databases
- Call APIs
- Access CRM data
- Process documents
- Send emails
- Update systems

Agents **decide which tools to use** based on the task. You don't program "if customer asks about order, call order API"—the agent figures that out.

<Info>
Tools are MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that provide standardized access to your systems. Learn more in [Tools & Connectors](/agents/tools-and-connectors).
</Info>

### 3. Guardrails & Boundaries

Agents work within boundaries you define:

- **Output validation** - Ensures responses match required format
- **Business rules** - Enforces policies and constraints
- **Human-in-the-loop** - Escalates critical decisions
- **Context limits** - Controls memory and token usage
- **Response modes** - Synchronous or background execution

<Warning>
Agents are powerful but not perfect. Always define boundaries, validate outputs, and use human-in-the-loop for critical decisions.
</Warning>

### 4. Self-Optimization

Agents improve automatically:

- **Smart Context** - Intelligently manages conversation memory
- **Prompt Optimization** - Automatically enhances prompts based on configuration
- **Adaptive Behavior** - Learns from usage patterns (coming soon)

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Not Ideal For

<Card title="When to Use Traditional Automation Instead" icon="triangle-exclamation">
- **Simple, predictable tasks** - If it's always the same steps, use a condition or function
- **High-volume, low-variability** - Agents have per-run costs; save them for complexity
- **Pure data transformation** - Use Map, Rules, or Functions for straightforward data manipulation
- **Time-critical micro-operations** - Agents add latency; use functions for speed-critical tasks
- **Deterministic calculations** - Use Rules for exact math and logic

**Rule of thumb**: If you can write "if X then Y" rules that cover all cases, use automation. If there's judgment, context, or exceptions, use agents.
</Card>

## Agent Architecture

Every agent has three main configuration areas:

### 1. Information Settings

Define your agent's identity and behavior:

- **Name & Description** - What this agent does
- **Response Mode** - Wait for completion or run in background
- **Agent Instructions** - Role, personality, and capabilities

<Tip>
Agent instructions are like a job description. Be specific about what the agent should do, how it should communicate, and what its limitations are.
</Tip>

[Learn more about Information Settings →](/agents/configuration/information-settings)

### 2. Provider Settings

Configure the AI model and integration:

- **Provider** - Workforce (custom), OpenAI, Claude, Gemini
- **Model** - Specific model version (GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, etc.)
- **API Key** - Securely stored authentication
- **Output Schema** - Define required response structure

<Info>
Different models excel at different tasks. GPT-4 for general intelligence, Claude for long context, Gemini for multimodal. Test to find what works best.
</Info>

[Learn more about Provider Settings →](/agents/configuration/provider-settings)

### 3. Context Settings

Control memory and reasoning behavior:

- **Smart Context** - Automatic conversation memory management
- **Prompt Optimization** - Auto-enhance prompts
- **Token Limits** - Maximum context size
- **Message History** - How many messages to remember
- **Reasoning Steps** - How many tool uses allowed

<Tip>
Higher token limits = more context = better decisions, but higher costs. Start with defaults and increase if needed.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific in Instructions" icon="bullseye">
    Don't say "help customers." Say "help customers with order tracking, returns within policy, and product questions. Escalate refunds over $200."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Give the Right Tools" icon="toolbox">
    Connect data sources the agent needs. More context = better decisions. But don't connect everything—focus on relevant tools.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Define Clear Boundaries" icon="fence">
    Specify what the agent can and cannot do. Define escalation criteria. Use output schemas to enforce structure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test with Real Scenarios" icon="flask">
    Use actual customer emails, edge cases, and exceptions. Agents learn from examples in instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Start Simple, Add Complexity" icon="seedling">
    Begin with basic instructions and a few tools. Test thoroughly. Then add more capabilities and guardrails.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor and Refine" icon="chart-line">
    Review agent conversations regularly. Refine instructions based on performance. Update tools as systems change.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Human-in-the-Loop" icon="user-check">
    Add human approval for critical decisions, high-value actions, or when confidence is low.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Agent Costs

Agents have per-run costs based on:

- **Model chosen** - GPT-4 > GPT-3.5, Claude Opus > Sonnet
- **Context size** - More tokens = higher cost
- **Tool usage** - Each tool call adds processing
- **Reasoning steps** - More steps = more tokens

<Info>
Use the **Workforce** model (our custom model) for the best balance of performance and cost. Or bring your own API keys to use any provider's pricing.
</Info>

See [Plans & Pricing](/get-started/plans-and-pricing) for details.
