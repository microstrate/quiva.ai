# Information Settings

The Information tab defines your agent's core identity and behavior. This is where you set the agent's name, describe what it does, choose how it executes, and write the instructions that guide its behavior.

## Configuration Fields

### Name

The agent's display name, shown throughout the platform and in logs.

### Response Mode

Controls how the agent executes within the flow. This is a critical setting that affects user experience and flow behavior.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Wait for Completion">
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <p><strong>Behavior:</strong> The flow waits for the agent to finish processing before moving to the next step or returning a response.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Use when:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Building API endpoints that need to return agent results</li>
        <li>Creating real-time chat experiences</li>
        <li>Form submissions that show agent responses</li>
        <li>Any synchronous interaction where users wait for results</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Users get immediate responses</li>
        <li>✅ Easier to handle errors and retries</li>
        <li>✅ Simpler flow logic</li>
        <li>✅ Can pass agent output to subsequent steps</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚠️ User waits for agent to complete (may be 5-30 seconds)</li>
        <li>⚠️ Request times out if agent takes too long</li>
        <li>⚠️ Not suitable for very long-running tasks</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Run in Background">
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <p><strong>Behavior:</strong> The flow responds immediately and the agent runs asynchronously. The trigger doesn't wait for completion.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Use when:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Processing emails or documents</li>
        <li>Running scheduled tasks</li>
        <li>Handling webhooks from external systems</li>
        <li>Long-running analysis or content generation</li>
        <li>Any async workflow where immediate response isn't needed</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Instant trigger response (no waiting)</li>
        <li>✅ Can handle very long-running tasks</li>
        <li>✅ Won't timeout on complex processing</li>
        <li>✅ Better for high-volume processing</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚠️ Can't return agent results to trigger</li>
        <li>⚠️ More complex to notify users of completion</li>
        <li>⚠️ Harder to handle errors in real-time</li>
        <li>⚠️ Need separate mechanism to show results</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Decision Tree:**

```
Does the user/system wait for the response?
├─ YES → Wait for Completion
└─ NO → Run in Background
    
Is this real-time interaction (chat, API, form)?
├─ YES → Wait for Completion
└─ NO → Run in Background

Will processing take more than 30 seconds?
├─ YES → Run in Background
└─ NO → Either (prefer Wait for Completion for simplicity)
```

<Warning>
**Important:** If using "Run in Background", subsequent steps in the flow cannot access the agent's response. Plan your flow accordingly.
</Warning>

**Example Scenarios:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Chat Widget - Wait for Completion" icon="comment">
    **Scenario:** Customer types question in chat widget
    
    **Flow:**
    - Trigger: Chat message received
    - Agent: Processes question and generates response
    - Response mode: **Wait for Completion**
    - Result: User sees agent response immediately in chat
    
    **Why:** User is waiting in the chat interface for a response.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Email Processing - Run in Background" icon="envelope">
    **Scenario:** Customer sends email to support@company.com
    
    **Flow:**
    - Trigger: Email received
    - Agent: Reads email, looks up customer, processes request
    - Response mode: **Run in Background**
    - Result: Email accepted immediately, agent processes async
    
    **Why:** No one is waiting for immediate response. Agent can take time to process thoroughly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Form Submission - Wait for Completion" icon="file-lines">
    **Scenario:** Lead fills out contact form
    
    **Flow:**
    - Trigger: Form submitted

## Example Responses

**Customer asks about feature availability:**
First search the Knowledge Base. If found, explain the feature clearly

available and ask what they're trying to accomplish (might suggest alternative).

**Refund request after 30 days:**
"I understand you'd like a refund. Our standard policy is 30 days, 
and I see your purchase was [X] days ago. While I can't process a 
refund outside our policy, I'd like to help find a solution. Would 
you be interested in an account credit instead? Or I can escalate 
this to our billing team to review your specific situation."

**Technical issue you can't solve:**
"I apologize for the trouble you're experiencing. This sounds like 
an issue that needs our technical team's attention. I'm creating a 
support ticket for you right now and escalating it to our tech team. 
Your ticket number is #[NUMBER]. They typically respond within 4 hours. 
Is there anything else I can help with while we wait?"

<Warning>
**Markdown Formatting:** The instructions field preserves markdown formatting. Use headers, lists, and bold text to organize instructions clearly.
</Warning>

**Placeholder Example in Field:**

```

---

## Prompt Field

The prompt field is located at the bottom of the Information tab and shows what input will be passed to the agent when it runs.

**Default Value:**

```
Prompt: ${trigger.body.message}
```

This variable mapping automatically passes the message from the trigger to the agent.

### Understanding the Prompt

The prompt is what the agent receives as input. It can come from:

- **Directly from trigger** - `${trigger.body.message}`, `${trigger.email.content}`
- **From previous steps** - `${step_id.response}`, `${http_request.data.question}`
- **Mapped from multiple sources** - Combine multiple fields

### When to Customize the Prompt

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Keep Default" icon="check">
    **Use the default when:**
    - Agent is directly connected to trigger
    - Trigger provides a single message/question field
    - Simple pass-through of user input
    
    **Example flows:**
    - Chat widget → Agent
    - Form submission → Agent
    - HTTP request with message → Agent
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Customize" icon="pen">
    **Customize when:**
    - Agent is not directly after trigger
    - Need to combine multiple fields
    - Processing output from previous step
    - Adding context or formatting
    
    **Example mappings:**
    ```
    Process this email: ${trigger.email.subject}
    
    Email content:
    ${trigger.email.body}
    ```
    
    Or combining multiple sources:
    ```
    Customer: ${trigger.form.name}
    Question: ${trigger.form.message}
    Order Number: ${trigger.form.order_number}
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Advanced Prompt Mapping

You can build complex prompts using variable mapping:

```
Context: ${previous_agent.summary}

New customer message: ${trigger.message}

Previous conversation:
${conversation_history}

Please respond to the customer's new message considering the full context.
```

## Best Practices

    - **Pattern 3:** `[Use Case] Assistant` - "Refund Assistant", "Onboarding Assistant"
    
    Pick one pattern and stick with it.

    - Clear role definition
    - Specific responsibilities
    - Communication style

  <Accordion title="Choose response mode carefully" icon="bolt">
    **Default to "Wait for Completion"** for:
    - User-facing interactions
    - API endpoints
    - Anything requiring immediate response
    
    **Use "Run in Background"** for:
    - Email processing
    - Scheduled tasks

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test with real scenarios" icon="flask">
    After configuring:
    1. Test with typical cases

    Monitor agent conversations and:
    - Add instructions for gaps you discover
    - Include new examples for common scenarios
